# üöÅ UAV Path Planning for Cellular Traffic Handling üì°

Welcome to our repository dedicated to optimizing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) path planning for efficient cellular traffic management. Our goal is to find the most optimized path for UAV deployment, accounting for obstacles such as cell towers, and ensuring smooth traffic flow.

## üîß Features:

- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):** Utilizes PSO algorithm to iteratively optimize the UAV path.
  
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Incorporates obstacle avoidance strategy to navigate around obstacles.
  
- **Visualization:** Provides visualization tools to plot the optimized path and obstacles.

## üìà How it Works:

1. **Initialization:** Initialize PSO parameters and particle positions.
  
2. **Optimization Loop:** Iteratively update particle positions and velocities using PSO equations.
  
3. **Cost Evaluation:** Evaluate the fitness (cost) of each particle's solution considering obstacle avoidance.
  
4. **Visualization:** Plot the best path found by the PSO algorithm.
