üöÅ UAV Path Planning for Cellular Traffic Handling üì°

Welcome to our repository dedicated to optimizing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) path planning for efficient cellular traffic management. Our goal is to find the most optimized path for UAV deployment, accounting for obstacles such as cell towers, and ensuring smooth traffic flow.

üîß Features:
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO): Harnesses the power of PSO algorithm to iteratively optimize the UAV path, ensuring efficiency and adaptability.

Obstacle Avoidance: Incorporates intelligent obstacle avoidance strategies, enabling UAVs to navigate seamlessly around obstacles and maintain uninterrupted cellular services.

Visualization: Offers intuitive visualization tools to plot the optimized path alongside obstacles, providing clear insights into the planning process.

üìà How it Works:
Initialization: Begin by setting up PSO parameters and initializing particle positions, laying the foundation for the optimization process.

Optimization Loop: Enter an iterative loop where particle positions and velocities are continuously updated using PSO equations, gradually converging towards the optimal solution.

Cost Evaluation: Evaluate the fitness (cost) of each particle's solution, meticulously considering obstacle avoidance to ensure the path's viability and efficiency.

Visualization: Visualize the best path discovered by the PSO algorithm, offering a comprehensive view of the optimized trajectory and the obstacles skillfully navigated.
